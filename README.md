# JavaScript Without snippets
Package for [Atom](https://atom.io)

The core package "[language-javascript](https://github.com/atom/language-javascript)" without snippets, so you can easily
add your own. Just disable the core package, and add your desired snippets
through Atom's default snippets.cson file.

Default snippets can be found commented out in [/snippets/language-javascript.cson]()
